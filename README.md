# Human Anatomy

Made by ABM for Shaukat Khanam.

An interactive 3D anatomy explorer built with React, Three.js, and shadcn/ui. Take the BodyParts3D adult male reference apart into **2,234 individually selectable meshes**, explore **15 anatomical systems**, and search **3,432 named concepts**.


## Explore

- Orbit, zoom, and select structures directly on the body.
- Toggle individual systems or use skeleton and organ presets.
- Move from assembled anatomy to a spaced inventory of every visible piece.
- Search anatomical names and source identifiers.
- Isolate a selected structure and read its details.
- Use compact controls and detail panels on mobile.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer. No API keys or accounts are needed.
